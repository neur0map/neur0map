# Hi, I'm neur0map üëã

## Cybersecurity Student & Builder

I'm a cybersecurity student focused on translating what I learn into practical tooling. Most days I'm breaking down exploits, documenting takeaways, and shaping them into resources other learners can use.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### [Manx](https://github.com/neur0map/manx) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/neur0map/manx?style=social)
**CLI documentation finder** that delivers instant, context-aware technical documentation directly in your terminal. Features both privacy-first snippet mode and AI-enhanced answer mode for rapid research during security assessments.

### [IPCrawler](https://github.com/neur0map/ipcrawler) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/neur0map/ipcrawler?style=social)
**Automated network reconnaissance tool** designed for penetration testing and CTF competitions. Performs comprehensive scanning from DNS enumeration to service analysis, with a real-time TUI and professional report generation.

### [Docrawl](https://github.com/neur0map/docrawl) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/neur0map/docrawl?style=social)
**Documentation reconnaissance helper** that crawls and organizes technical references so I can document findings faster. Built to reinforce my beginner-level Python skills while supporting security research workflows.

> *All of these tools support my Rust learning journey. I lean on AI as a coding partner while working to understand the language fundamentals.*
